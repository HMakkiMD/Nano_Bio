This repository contains data from coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations investigating the self-assembly of amphiphilic nanoparticles and their interactions with biological environments.

1. Data associated with the study “Predictive Amphiphile Design Enables Control of Self-Assembled Nanoparticle–Cell Membrane Interactions” can be found in the Self-assembled Nanoparticle–Cell Membrane Interactions folder. A dedicated README.md file within this folder provides detailed information on the dataset and simulation protocols.
